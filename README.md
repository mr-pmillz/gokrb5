Nothing to see here. Just a slightly modified fork of the amazing `gokrb5` package available here: https://github.com/ropnop/gokrb5

I had to export some functions in order to get my tool [kerbrute](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute) to work, so I forked the package. You don't want to use this probably.

## Update

ToDo: Add socks5 proxy support
